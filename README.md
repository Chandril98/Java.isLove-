Did some crazy string_handling..gonna post more later on 


**1.StringW1.java -** 
/Initialy the qution was Q. This Program takes a String as input and print the word ending with letter s
I made some modification. Why only letter s have all the fun .There are 26 other lettters .Now You can search for any EndLetter .
Even if you are not from this universe code will run just fine for you ! Happy coding bros!!


**2.Numtwist.java -**
/It is not much,but it's a honest work.
WAP to determine even and odd position digit of a given number .
Then print the difference of their sum
